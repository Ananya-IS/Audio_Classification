Audio Signal Classification with CNN

Introduction

This project aims to classify animal sounds using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model extracts features from audio signals, particularly using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and classifies them into different animal categories.

Overview

Environmental sound classification is a growing research area with numerous real-world applications, such as multimedia indexing, assistance for the deaf, smart home security, automotive safety, and industrial predictive maintenance. This project focuses on classifying sounds from five different animals: Dog, Cat, Cow, Hen, and Frog.
